**The Shark Jack**

The Shark Jack is a hotplug attack tool that uses DuckyScript and Bash to deliever payloads to any ethernet port with an active connection.

As a finger sized linux computer it can execute commands for tools like Nmap to get recon on a wifi network or get ip addresses from a device.

It's bassicaly the Rubber Ducky with a ethernet jack using linux to deliever network based attacks.

Imagination is the limit here on what this device can do which is why I created my own payloads different then scanning devices on a network (not saying it's lame lol)
